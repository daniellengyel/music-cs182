To make the jupyter notebook work:
1) Download the 1.8GB subset from MSD (https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset#subset)
2) If necessary, unzip the downloaded file.
3) Without modifying the directory name ("MillionSongSubset") or contents of the downloaded data, place the directory in the "data" directory in the root.
